Perfect 👍 Thanks for sharing the repo screenshot and the **Content/** structure. Since your project already has controls (walk, run, crouch, jump) and core folders (Blueprints, Characters, SkyTown, etc.), I’ll customize the **README.md** for your repository.

Here’s a ready-to-use version tailored to your project:

This is an **Unreal Engine 5** demo project experimenting with AAA-style gameplay mechanics.  
It includes character movement systems (walk, run, crouch, jump, etc.) and a sample level setup.  
Currently, this project is **incomplete** and serves as a base to build upon.
